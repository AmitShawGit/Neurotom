Q. If I do not see an improvement in my symptoms, can I stop taking Neuroatom 400mg Tablet?
No, do not stop taking Neurotam 400mg Tablet on your own. Stopping it suddenly may have unwanted effects like twitching and  jerking movements. If Neurotam 400mg Tablet 
does not improve your symptoms, consult your doctor. The doctor may suggest a slow reduction of Neurotam 400mg Tablet dose.
